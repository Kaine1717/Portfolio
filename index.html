          <h3>Web Designing</h3>
          <p>I started to learn about UX design in 2021.<br>
            I recently began coding. I actually coded this website.</p>

        <p>This was my first app design. It was a project where we followed the instructor,<br> but after finishing up the course I went back and made a lot more of the buttons functional. <br>
        Try it out now by clicking the link above.</p>
      </div> <br>
      <div>
        <img src="images/Maynooth-screenshot.png" alt="Maynooth website design"><br>
        <a class="web-link" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/6e4c77dc-aa7a-431a-a49c-dfab7e7edeb1-3b1f/?fullscreen&hints=off">Maynooth website design</a>
        <p>The Maynooth website design was a real life project for my previous instructor. <br>
          He gave it to his students as a test, just to see how well we worked on projects by ourselves. <br>
          On this first page, you can go to the living room off of the drop down menu under "shop by room". <br>
          This will take you to the living room section, where you'll see the option to shop by price, or living room furniture piece.<br>
          Selecting the logo at the top will always take you back to the homepage. The cart at the top right will take you to the cart as well as the checkout menu.<br>
          On each page you can click the contact us link at the bottom left to contact the support team.</p>
      </div> <br>

        <p>This is a website design I made for fun for a friend. She once had a website but I wanted to see if I could make something more suited for her.<br>
        On this first page you see a nav bar at the top, some of her own t-shirt designs and then testimonials. The first t-shirt design shows what would happen when you hover over a shirt.<br>
        It/ll show the official name as well as the price. The logo in the top left will always take you back to this home page. Every button on the nav bar is functional besides the vintage wear and the search button.<br>
        Clicking the cart icon will take you through the purchase menus.</p>
      </div> <br>
      <div>
        <img src="images/RF-app.png" alt="RareFind App design"> <br>
        <a class="web-link" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/3ed1f64e-45c6-4716-a05f-1fd94953c778-6b82/?fullscreen&hints=off">RareFind App design</a>
        <p>This app design was the last one to be added to my portfolio. It was my favorite simply because I really wanted to try to stay true to the website<br>
        and just condense the experience. I was able make the app much more up to date. From the first page, if you click on the "Samurai" shirt,<br>
        you will be taken to another screen that inlcudes the description, sizes, as well as shipping preferences. Scroll down and press "add to cart" to be taken to your current cart inventory.<br>
        You can then select next at the bottom of the page to go through the purchase menus. There are also arrows in the bottom right to take you back to the previous pages. <br>
        Again, The same buttons are functional on the nav bar in the app as the website.</p>
